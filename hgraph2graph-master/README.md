# Description of the project

This project is a reimplementation of the model introduced in the following paper: "Hierarchical Generation of Molecular Graphs using Structural Motifs." ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03230.pdf)). Specifically, the code
is a slightly updated version of that published by the authors in
this [repository](https://github.com/wengong-jin/hgraph2graph)
. The code presented in this project is commented to facilitate the reading.

**Important:** Even if the code presented in this repository is almost entirely based on the code published by the
authors in their [repository](https://github.com/wengong-jin/hgraph2graph) the results might differ for some
reason. Therefore, for any benchmark test to be performed on the models of the paper, please refer to the original code.

## How to start

The packages can be installed following the first commands written in the IPython Notebook [Script_HierVAE.ipynb](https://github.com/EdoardoGruppi/Drug_Design_Models/blob/main/hgraph2graph-master/Script_HierVAE.ipynb). The latter enable to directly run the code on platforms such as Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks or Kaggle.

## Run the code

The code can be executed running cell by cell the aforementioned notebook. If you are using VSC or PyCharm you can convert the .ipynb notebook to a traditional .py file before starting.
