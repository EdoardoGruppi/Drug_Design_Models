# Drug_Design_Models

This project is a reimplementation of the models introduced in the following papers:

1. "Multiobjective de novo drug design with recurrent neural networks and nondominated sorting." [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-020-00419-6). [Official GitHub repository](https://github.com/jyasonik/MoleculeMO).

2. "REINVENT 2.0: An AI Tool for De Novo Drug Design." ([paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00915)). [Official GitHub repository](https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent/tree/master/data).

3. "Hierarchical generation of molecular graphs using structural motifs." ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03230.pdf)). [repository](https://github.com/wengong-jin/hgraph2graph)

Specifically, the code is a slightly updated version of that published by the authors in their projects.

**Important:** Even if the code presented in this repository is almost entirely based on the code published by the
authors in their works the results might differ for some reason. Therefore, for any benchmark test to be performed on the models of the paper, please refer to the original code.
